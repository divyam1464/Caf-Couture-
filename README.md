ðŸ“Œ About the Project

â€œBecause even a coffee website deserves to wear couture."

CafÃ© Couture is more than just a website â€” itâ€™s an immersive digital experience that reflects my passion for thoughtful design and purposeful coding. This was built as part of my personal front-end development learning journey, where I focused on layout mastery, responsive design, and elegant user experience.

The aesthetic inspiration comes from the elegance of French cafÃ© culture â€” every section flows with intention, balance, and charm.
